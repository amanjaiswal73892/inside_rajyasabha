# Inside Rajya Sabha: Visualization of Q/A hour

* The Rajya Sabha is the upper house of the bicameral parliament of India that held planned sessions to discuss political bills. Every year number of sessions occur where new bill and policies are presented to be passed to become law, and questioning period is held every day during that sessions. Discussions and procedures in Rajya Sabha sometimes get complicated to understand for someone who does not know much about how things work in the parliament. 
  This is where visualizations come into the picture to provide the underlying knowledge of the data. Dashboard of the application is developed where a person can get a bigger picture of what is going in the parliament. There is valuable information in these questions description that is leveraged using NLP techniques. Application vectorize these question description and show the visualizations in the embedding space. This space provides a way to interact and explore these questions in a way that is not overwhelming to the user.
